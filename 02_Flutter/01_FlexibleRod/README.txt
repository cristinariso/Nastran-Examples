sol145.dat generates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors across all speeds (set speeds to positive to turn the eigenvectors off)

sol145_eigenvector.dat generates the eigenvectors at the estimated speed of the hump mode flutter mechanism

postprocess.py is a Python script to extract the flutter summary from the .f06 files for easier reading into visualization tools
